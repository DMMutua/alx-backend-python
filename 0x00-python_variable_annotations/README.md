# Python - Variable Annotations
Variable annotations are a feature introduced in Python 3.0 that allows you to add optional type hints to variable names in your code.<br>
This means that you can specify the expected data type for a variable when it is declared, which can help improve the readability, maintainability, and correctness of your code.<br>
